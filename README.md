# LIRI-BOT

1. Welcome to LIRI

For the music lover, navigating across mutlile sites can be time consuming and difficult. LIRI combines information from some of the 
most popular sites into one easy to use command line application.

LIRI will search Spotify for Songs, Bands in Town for Concerts, and OMDB for Movies.

Unlike SIRI, LIRI does not require speaking- meaning- you don't have to pause your music!


2. App Overview

    LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

    The four basic commands are "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", "movie-this" and "do-what-it-says"


3. Instructions

For each command type "node liri.js {command} {value}"

Examples:

node liri.js movie-this frozen
node liri.js concert-this metallica
node liri.js spotify-this-song lemonade


The do-what-it-says command displays song information for a random track, a value is not necessary.
node liri.js do-what-it-says 

If a value contains a space, you may either type a + where each space would be found, or place the value in quotes.

Examples:

node liri.js spotify-this-song single+ladies
node liri.ja spotify-this-song "single ladies"
